## 🔍 Scenario
The accountant received a suspicious PPT titled "Urgent New Order". It triggered a SIEM alert after a suspicious download. I was tasked with analyzing the file’s behavior using threat intel tools.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- 🛡️ [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com)
- 🔬 [Any.run](https://any.run)
- 🧠 Hybrid Analysis

## 🧩 What I Did

- Extracted the ZIP using password `cyberdefenders.org`.
- Found a `hash.txt` containing the **MD5 hash** of the malware sample.
- Searched this hash (`12c1842c3ccafe7408c23ebf292ee3d9`) on VirusTotal and Any.run.
- Identified:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Command & Control (C2) server
  - Initial DLL requested (`sqlite3.dll`)
  - RC4 encryption key
  - MITRE ATT&CK ID used (`T1555`)
  - Targeted directory for DLL deletion
  - Time for self-deletion after exfiltration

## 🤯 Interesting Discovery
Malware can embed payloads in seemingly innocent files like PPTs, then download executables in the background while evading detection. Also learned about identifying C2 servers through **Relations > Contacted URLs** in VirusTotal.

## 📌 Reflection
This lab was great for sharpening my skills in malware behavior analysis using static and dynamic intel tools. I got to understand how attackers blend into normal traffic and what key indicators analysts rely on.
