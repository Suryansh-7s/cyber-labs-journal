# 🧠 CyberDefenders Lab – Amadey  
**Date:** June 27, 2025  
**Category:** Endpoint Forensics  
**Level:** Tier 1  
**Status:** ✅ Completed (7/7)

## 🔍 Scenario  
A suspicious after-hours alert from EDR flagged malicious activity on a Windows workstation. Investigation confirmed Amadey Trojan Stealer involvement. I was tasked with analyzing a **memory dump** using Volatility 3 to trace the malware’s execution flow and persistence.

## 🧪 Tools Used  
- 🧠 Volatility 3  
- 🔎 Strings analysis  
- 🕵️‍♂️ File & Network forensics  
- 📑 Threat Intelligence

---

## 🧩 What I Did  
- Loaded the `.vmem` file into Volatility 3 and used:
  - `windows.pstree` to trace suspicious processes
  - `windows.cmdline` to find execution paths
  - `windows.netscan` to identify C2 connections
  - `windows.memmap` + `strings` to inspect HTTP requests
  - `windows.filescan` to uncover hidden persistence locations
- Identified `lssass.exe` as the rogue process mimicking `lsass.exe`
- Tracked C2 communication, file downloads, and execution flow
- Mapped malware’s child process, loaded DLLs, and task scheduler persistence

## 🤯 Key Learnings  
- Amadey uses deceptive naming (e.g., `lssass.exe`) to avoid detection  
- Initiates HTTP GET requests directly from memory  
- Establishes persistence via Windows Task Scheduler  
- Sharpened my skills in memory analysis and process tracing with Volatility 3
