# Lespion – CyberDefenders Lab Journal  
**Date:** 28 June 2025
**Track:** SOC Analyst Tier 1  
**Completed Lab:** Lespion  
**Badge:** [View Achievement](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/achievements/suryansh7s/lespion/)  
**Focus Area:** Threat Intelligence & OSINT

---

## 🧠 Summary

This lab revolved around tracing an insider threat using publicly available data. I analyzed leaked GitHub files, social media presence, and image evidence to track the insider’s activities, location, and tools used for crypto mining.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Examined `Github.txt` for exposed credentials, API keys, and tool usage  
- Used **Sherlock** to trace the user's social footprint (Instagram, Steam)  
- Applied **Google Image Search** to `office.jpg` and `Webcam.png` to geolocate city and surveillance footage  
- Identified signs of **XMRig mining**, travel data, and family ties through image & metadata analysis  
- Confirmed company location (Birmingham), user holiday destination (Singapore), and surveillance location (Indiana)

## 💡 Takeaways

This lab emphasized how real-world OSINT techniques can quickly unravel insider threats. Even minimal leaked data — like a photo or a username — can snowball into precise attribution when pieced together smartly.

Also learned the importance of scanning GitHub repos and open images for embedded intel — something many attackers overlook when leaking their own tracks.

## 🗒️ Reflection

I enjoyed the investigative pace of this challenge — it felt like digital detective work. The non-technical angle (like reading usernames and recognizing landmarks) balanced well with practical tool usage. Solid reminder of how powerful open-source intelligence really is in the hands of defenders.

Definitely ready to explore more advanced OSINT and Threat Intel labs ahead.
