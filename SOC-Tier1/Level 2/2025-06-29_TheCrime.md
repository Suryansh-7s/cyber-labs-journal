## 🧠 Summary

This lab simulated an investigation into a suspicious death potentially linked to financial stress, debts, and digital clues left on a mobile device. My task was to analyze an Android image dump using forensics tools to trace the victim’s activities, locations, contacts, and intentions before the incident.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Used **ALEAPP** to parse the Android image and extract app usage and device metadata  
- Examined **SQLite databases** using DB Browser to explore chat history, location records, and financial transactions  
- Identified the **SHA256 hash** of the primary trading app used by the victim  
- Extracted details of a **250,000 debt** owed to an individual named **Shady Wahab**  
- Found geolocation data pointing to the **Nile Ritz-Carlton** as the victim's last known location  
- Recovered flight booking info showing a planned trip to **Las Vegas**  
- Analyzed Discord logs to reveal a planned meetup at **The Mob Museum**

## 💡 Takeaways

This was a solid introduction to Android forensics and mobile data extraction. Tools like ALEAPP offer structured insight into a user’s behavior, especially when cross-referenced with messaging apps, GPS logs, and browser history. 

The challenge also highlighted how digital trails can form a cohesive story — apps, chats, and travel logs together created a full picture of the victim’s final movements and social circle.

## 🗒️ Reflection

This lab was like putting together a puzzle — every small artifact had a bigger implication. It sharpened my focus on endpoint forensics, especially for mobile devices, which are increasingly central to investigations today.

Looking forward to more labs involving complex datasets and cross-tool correlation.
