## üß† Summary

The ‚ÄúRed Stealer‚Äù lab focused on analyzing a malware sample using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and malware databases. The goal was to understand its behavior, communication patterns, and categorization within the threat landscape. I worked across platforms like VirusTotal, ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar, and ANY.RUN.

## üîç What I Did

- Queried **VirusTotal** to determine the malware‚Äôs classification (**Trojan**) and original filename (**Wextract**)  
- Extracted the **submission timestamp** to VirusTotal for timeline correlation  
- Looked up **MITRE ATT&CK ID T1005** for data collection behavior  
- Used DNS traffic analysis from sandbox logs to confirm connections to **facebook.com**  
- Identified outbound communication to **IP 77.91.124.55:19071**  
- Found **YARA rule `detect_Redline_Stealer`** on MalwareBazaar authored by **Varp0s**  
- Discovered malware alias **RECORDSTEALER** on ThreatFox  
- Examined DLL imports and spotted **ADVAPI32.dll** used for privilege escalation

## üí° Takeaways

This lab emphasized the value of publicly available threat intelligence platforms when analyzing malware. Using services like VirusTotal, ThreatFox, and MalwareBazaar in a connected workflow helped me rapidly pivot between indicators and enrich findings with community-driven signatures.

The DLL analysis step was also a key insight ‚Äî many privilege escalation tactics rely on consistent, traceable API usage that can be caught with the right detection rules.

## üóíÔ∏è Reflection

Red Stealer reminded me how attackers frequently disguise known malware families under new variants. Recognizing patterns, naming aliases, and knowing where to look are all vital for Tier-1 SOC analysts.

Overall, a powerful exercise in how OSINT tools empower defenders with clarity, speed, and confidence during incident analysis and response.
