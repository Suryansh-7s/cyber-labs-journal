## 🧠 Summary

The Insider lab provided a forensic deep-dive into a potentially compromised Linux machine. Using a disk image and forensic tools like **FTK Imager**, I analyzed system artifacts, searched for malicious activity, and traced suspicious user behavior. This lab revolved around post-compromise activities like credential dumping, hidden files, and bash script taunts.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Confirmed the system was running **Kali Linux**  
- Extracted and hashed key files like `access.log` for validation  
- Identified suspicious downloads like `mimikatz_trunk.zip`, hinting at credential harvesting  
- Found hidden content such as `/root/Desktop/SuperSecretFile.txt` and command-line tool usage like **binwalk**  
- Recovered bash history indicating lateral movement attempts and insider taunts  
- Analyzed user behavior (e.g., `postgres` using `su` for root escalation multiple times)  
- Discovered a planted image used as attack evidence: `irZLAohL.jpeg`  
- Traced Karen’s motive via a text checklist and located the working directory for staged attacks

## 💡 Takeaways

- Even basic forensic images can reveal extensive detail if examined systematically  
- Bash history is gold—command lineage, file creation, and intent are all revealed  
- Tools like **mimikatz**, **binwalk**, and script automation were core indicators of attack stages  
- Metadata and file system paths offer critical insights into a user's actions and privilege escalations

## 🗒️ Reflection

This lab was rich in forensic indicators and exposed how much power a single user with root access can wield. The insider angle added narrative weight, making the hunt for clues engaging. I now better appreciate how forensic triage builds the story of compromise—from motives to methods—and why it’s essential for blue teams to proactively monitor insider behavior.
