## üß† Summary

The DanaBot lab focused on analyzing network traffic associated with a malware infection. The exercise emphasized how to trace initial infection vectors, execution techniques, and payload delivery using tools like **Wireshark**, **ANY.RUN**, and **VirusTotal**. It highlighted typical Command & Control (C2) behavior of the DanaBot banking Trojan.

## üîç What I Did

- Used **Wireshark** to identify suspicious traffic originating from the attacker‚Äôs IP: `62.173.142.148`  
- Located the malicious JavaScript file: `allegato_708.js` used for initial access  
- Pulled its **SHA-256 hash** and validated it on **VirusTotal**  
- Identified **`wscript.exe`** as the process used to execute the script  
- Analyzed further dropped files and recognized a **.dll file** as the second stage  
- Extracted and verified the **MD5 hash** of the second payload

## üí° Takeaways

This lab served as a strong reminder that understanding malware flow‚Äîfrom delivery to execution‚Äîis crucial for incident response. Recognizing known malicious processes like `wscript.exe` and correlating network artifacts can greatly reduce investigation time.

It also reinforced the importance of memory-safe scripting environments and blocking untrusted script execution on endpoints.

## üóíÔ∏è Reflection

DanaBot‚Äôs C2 traffic patterns and its staged execution flow gave me real-world exposure to how financial Trojans operate. These behaviors are subtle in network logs but devastating in impact. This lab helped refine my packet analysis skills and gave me confidence in correlating hash evidence with behavior.

With every lab, I‚Äôm gaining more fluency in how malware communicates and how defenders can cut it off at the knees.
