# 🧪 Cyber Labs Journal

This repository is a personal journal of all the blue team labs I complete—primarily on [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/). Each lab entry includes my thought process, answers, tools used, and key takeaways.

The goal? To build practical SOC Analyst skills by getting hands-on with packet captures, log analysis, and detection workflows—one lab at a time.

## ✍️ Why This Journal?

I’m maintaining this to:
- Track my learning in a structured way
- Reflect on how I solve each lab
- Build a habit of documenting investigations
- Eventually use it as a showcase for my SOC skills

Stay tuned — more labs and writeups coming soon!
