# üß™ Cyber Labs Journal

This repository is a personal journal of all the blue team labs I complete‚Äîprimarily on [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/). Each lab entry includes my thought process, answers, tools used, and key takeaways.

The goal? To build practical SOC Analyst skills by getting hands-on with packet captures, log analysis, and detection workflows‚Äîone lab at a time.
